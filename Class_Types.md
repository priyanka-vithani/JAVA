In Java, there are several types of classes, each serving a specific purpose. Here’s a simple breakdown with their key differences:

⸻

1. Concrete Class
   •	Definition: A regular class that can be instantiated.
   •	Usage: Used to create objects.
   •	Example:

    class Car {
        void drive() {
            System.out.println("Driving");
        }
    }



⸻

2. Abstract Class
   •	Definition: A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods.
   •	Usage: Used as a base for subclasses; provides partial implementation.
   •	Example:

    abstract class Animal {
        abstract void sound();
    }



⸻

3. Interface
   •	Definition: A collection of abstract methods (Java 8+ allows default and static methods).
   •	Usage: Achieve multiple inheritance and abstraction.
   •	Example:

    interface Flyable {
        void fly();
    }



⸻

4. Final Class
   •	Definition: A class that cannot be extended.
   •	Usage: Prevent inheritance.
   •	Example:

    final class Constants {
        static final double PI = 3.14;
    }



⸻

5. Static Class (Nested Static Class)
   •	Definition: A static class defined inside another class.
   •	Usage: Doesn’t need a reference of outer class.
   •	Example:

    class Outer {
        static class Inner {
            void show() {
                System.out.println("Static Inner Class");
            }
        }
    }



⸻

6. Inner Class (Non-static Nested Class)
   •	Definition: A class defined within another class.
   •	Usage: Has access to outer class members.
   •	Example:

    class Outer {
        class Inner {
            void display() {
                System.out.println("Inner class");
            }
        }
    }



⸻

7. Anonymous Class
   •	Definition: A class without a name, defined and instantiated in a single statement.
   •	Usage: For one-time use, especially in event handling.
   •	Example:

    Runnable r = new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running...");
    }
    };



⸻

8. Enum Class
   •	Definition: Special class to define constants.
   •	Usage: Type-safe way to represent fixed set of constants.
   •	Example:

    enum Day {
        MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY;
    }

Summary Table:

Type	Can Instantiate	Supports Inheritance	Abstract Methods	Typical Use Case
Concrete Class	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	❌ No	Regular object creation
Abstract Class	❌ No	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	Base class with partial implementation
Interface	❌ No	✅ Yes (implements)	✅ Yes	Multiple inheritance
Final Class	✅ Yes	❌ No	❌ No	Prevent subclassing
Static Class	✅ Yes (if nested)	❌ No	✅ Yes/No	Utility/helper classes
Inner Class	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes/No	Access to outer class
Anonymous Class	✅ Yes (inline)	❌ No (one-time)	✅ Yes/No	Quick override for interface/abstract
Enum	✅ Yes	❌ No (limited)	❌ No	Constant definitions
